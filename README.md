## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShaileshGodghase/Ace_Interview/main/public/home.png?token=GHSAT0AAAAAAB5S2YRZWTRTBYTVW4DTSJCAY6KX63A)

Ace Interview is a web platform that allows users to conduct technical interviews with audio, video, real-time chat, and a real-time code editor. It is designed to help software developers prepare for technical interviews by simulating the interview experience. The platform allows the interviewer and interviewee to communicate via audio and video, while also providing a real-time chat feature for additional communication. 

Additionally, the platform includes a real-time code editor, which allows the interviewer to ask coding questions and the interviewee to write and execute code during the interview. This feature enables the interviewer to evaluate the interviewee's coding skills and problem-solving abilities in a more realistic and interactive way. Overall, Ace Interview aims to provide a comprehensive and interactive way for software developers to prepare for technical interviews.
